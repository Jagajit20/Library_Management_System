# Library_Management_System
A mini-project using C++ as main language with the sole aim of making a manual management system for a library. The system stores data of book, students &amp; admins which can be manipulated only by an administrator. The system uses "File handling" for storing data locally. This can however be improved in future using a DBMS like SQLite or a mySQL server for security.
